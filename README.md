# RPi-vespai-C2 - Vesp Detection System

🐝 **Vesp detection system** with real-time computer vision, web dashboard, and SMS alerts and Push Notification (To be tested).

The system is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 5 with either a USB camera or a Raspberry Pi Camera Module. The difference between this and RPi-VespAI is that this project is experimenting using two cameras. RPi-VespAI uses a YOLO26 deep learning trained model to identify and differentiate between Asian hornets (Vespa velutina) and European hornets (Vespa crabro) in real-time. 


## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Real-time Detection**: YOLO26-based computer vision model used with custom vesp detection training
- 📊 **Web Dashboard**: Live video feed with statistics and detection analytics
- 🌍 **Multilingual Support**: Complete English/German/French interface with flag-based switching
- 📱 **SMS Alerts**: Automated notifications via Lox24 API with intelligent rate limiting - To be Tested
- 🎯 **Motion Detection**: CPU-efficient motion-based optimization
- 📈 **Data Analytics**: Comprehensive logging, hourly statistics, and detection history
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized web interface 
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized**: Non-blocking operations, data caching, reduced API calls

## 🚀 Quick Overview

### 1. Hardware and Software
This will probably work on a normal PC with Linux. 
However its been designed and tested for Raspberry Pi 5 with the goal to make it self contained running on a battery and solar charger.
For the camera: A normal USB WebCam e.g Logitech can work.
The Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 is supported through Picamera2 while preserving the USB camera option.

- ✅ **Raspberry Pi 5** (full support)
- **Memory**: 2GB RAM minimum, 4GB recommended
- **Storage**: 1GB free space for models and dependencies, SSD Recommended
- **Camera**: USB camera or CSI camera (Raspberry Pi)

The installation is based on PyTorch and the installation process will install all the required dependencies - ideally using uv.
- **Python**: 3.7+ (3.9+ recommended for Raspberry Pi)  
- The system was developed on Python 3.13 as the default with the Debian distro.


### 2. Installation
Refer to the Install.md doc under the docs folder
Scripts provided to install as a service, autostart on boot.
Various variables stored in .env file (use .env-template)

### 3. Access Dashboard
Once Installed and running, open your browser to: `http://localhost:8081`
or replace localhost with the IP address if the RPi.

#### Demo mode
To get a **demo**: Click on the Red Live button in the Live Feed. This will change the feed from Camera to the Dataset, streaming images from the dataset into the detector with results then logged as if running live.

- **Live Video Feed**: Real-time camera stream with detection overlays
- **Statistics Cards**: Frame count, detection counts, system stats
- **Detection Log**: Chronological list of all detections with timestamps
- **Hourly Chart**: 24-hour detection history visualization
- **System Monitor**: CPU, RAM, temperature monitoring
- **Inference Time**: Time taken by model to classify image

# Security Considerations
- Never commit `.env` files to git
- Use strong SMS API credentials
- Consider VPN access for remote monitoring
- Regular security updates on Pi OS

# Performance Optimization
- Use motion detection (`--motion`) to reduce CPU usage
- Adjust confidence threshold based on your environment
- Monitor system resources via dashboard
- Heatsink with Fan highly recommended
- Moving from a YOLOv8 Model to YOLO26 reduced the inference time taken from 2700ms down to around 1700ms using a USB Webcam and down to <500ms using the Pi Camera Module 3
- Using the ONNX format further improved and lowered inference time and improved detection box placement


## Testing
- Test with various lighting conditions
- Check web interface on mobile devices
- Validate motion detection accuracy
- Startup/Shutdown process
- Capacity/space management: Max logs and images saved as set in .env
